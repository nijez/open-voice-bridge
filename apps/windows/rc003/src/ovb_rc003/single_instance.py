"""Windows named-mutex single-instance guard for bridge mode (XRBM-021).

The no-argument bridge (``python -m ovb_rc003`` / the packaged
``OpenVoiceBridgeRC003.exe``) is a long-lived, mostly invisible owner of
BLE, Raw Input, synthetic key and audio resources. Starting a second
instance in the same Windows logon session would race both instances over
those resources - so at most one bridge instance may hold them at a time.
``--settings``, ``--dry-run`` and help/version inspection never touch those
resources at all and must remain available regardless of whether the
bridge is already running - this guard is therefore only ever constructed
around bridge-mode startup (see ``__main__.py``), never around those other
modes.

Fail-closed contract (XRBM-021 review round 1 P1 #1): a caller that cannot
PROVE it is the sole owner - whether because another instance already owns
the mutex (``DuplicateInstanceError``) or because the Win32 API itself
could not be used to check at all (``SingleInstanceUnavailableError``) -
must never fall through to starting the bridge anyway. Both exceptions are
therefore handled identically by ``__main__.py``'s ``_run_bridge()``: show
a visible notice, exit with a deterministic nonzero code, and never call
``app.main()``.

Ctypes ABI: every Win32 call here (``CreateMutexW``, ``ReleaseMutex``,
``CloseHandle``, ``MessageBoxW``) declares an explicit ``argtypes``/
``restype`` using ``ctypes.wintypes`` before it is ever invoked - the same
"never leave a handle/pointer-sized argument at ctypes' unprototyped
default" rule XRBM-019 established for ``PostMessageW`` (see
raw_input_windows.py) and XRBM-020 established for ``SendInput``'s
INPUT-array pointer (see win32_input.py). ``wintypes.HANDLE`` is
pointer-sized on every host (backed by ``c_void_p``), so it is never
truncated on 64-bit Windows the way an unprototyped bare ``int`` argument
would be.

Last-error capture (XRBM-021 review round 1 P1 #2): Win32's last-error
value is thread-local state that ANY subsequent Win32 call can overwrite -
so it must be read immediately adjacent to ``CreateMutexW`` itself, inside
the same ``_real_create_mutex()`` call, never via a separate later call.
``_real_create_mutex()`` therefore uses a ``ctypes.WinDLL(...,
use_last_error=True)`` handle (ctypes caches the error value itself, right
after the call returns) and returns the handle and that error code together
as one ``MutexCreationResult`` - there is no standalone, independently
callable "get the last error now" function for callers to accidentally
call too late.

Testability: the real Win32 calls are isolated in module-level
``_real_*`` functions, each individually injectable via
``BridgeInstanceGuard``'s keyword-only ``_create_mutex``/``_release_mutex``/
``_close_handle`` parameters - the same dependency-injection seam
``win32_input.py``'s ``_sender`` parameter already established, letting
tests/test_single_instance.py exercise the full acquire/duplicate/release/
cleanup contract deterministically on any OS without ``ctypes.windll``
(which does not exist off Windows). Only the ``_real_*`` functions
themselves call ``_require_windows()`` - the guard class never does - so an
injected fake never has to fight a platform gate that has nothing to do
with the logic under test.

    Use as a context manager around bridge-mode startup::

        with BridgeInstanceGuard():

    - First owner: ``__enter__`` returns normally; ``__exit__`` always
      attempts ``ReleaseMutex`` THEN ``CloseHandle`` (best-effort - one
      failing never skips the other), INCLUDING when the wrapped body
      raises (ordinary context-manager semantics: ``__exit__`` always runs
      on the way out of a ``with`` block - this is what gives the "release
      in finally" guarantee without an explicit ``try/finally`` here). A
      cleanup failure (FALSE return or a raised exception from either call)
      ALWAYS raises ``MutexCleanupError`` - even when the wrapped body
      itself also raised. This never discards the body's exception: Python
      chains it onto ``MutexCleanupError.__context__`` automatically (see
      that class's docstring), so both are observable rather than the
      cleanup failure being silently accepted whenever a body exception
      happened to already be in flight.
    - Duplicate owner: ``CreateMutexW`` still hands back a valid handle to
      the EXISTING object (Win32 semantics - the caller does not become the
      owner), so ``__enter__`` closes that handle immediately (never
      releases a mutex it never owned) and raises ``DuplicateInstanceError``
      before the ``with`` block's body ever runs - a close failure here is
      folded into that same exception's message rather than raised
      separately, since the duplicate signal is the primary, more
      actionable event. Note that ``__exit__`` is NOT invoked when
      ``__enter__`` raises (a plain Python ``with``-statement guarantee),
      which is exactly why the duplicate path must close its own handle
      right here rather than relying on ``__exit__``.
    - Acquisition failure (``CreateMutexW`` itself failed, e.g. access
      denied): ``__enter__`` raises ``SingleInstanceUnavailableError``.
      There is no handle to close in this case (a failed ``CreateMutexW``
      returns NULL).

    Every raised message deliberately omits the raw handle value (DoD 4:
    "no raw address/handle is persisted or logged") - only Win32 error
    codes (small integers, not addresses) and fixed diagnostic strings like
    "ReleaseMutex returned FALSE" ever appear in them.
