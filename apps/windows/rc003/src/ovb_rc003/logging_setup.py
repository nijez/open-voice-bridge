"""Logging configuration that never touches voice content or device identity.

Callers must only ever log opaque markers (button names, session ids,
sample/frame counts, boolean flags) - never a Bluetooth address, HID
interface path, device token, or decoded voice content. This module doesn't
attempt to scrub arbitrary strings after the fact (a redaction filter would
give false confidence); the guarantee instead comes from code review plus
tests/test_privacy_contract.py, which statically scans this package's source
for the sensitive field names and MAC-address-shaped literals.

``log_dir``/``log_file_path`` (XRBM-029) expose this module's canonical
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\OpenVoiceBridge\\RC003\\logs\\app.log`` location WITHOUT the
side effect ``get_logger()`` has of creating that directory - the settings
window's "open log directory" entry needs to tell a user "this doesn't exist
yet, the app hasn't run" as an honest fact, which would be impossible if
merely asking the question always created the directory first.
``describe_log_location``/``open_log_location`` build on those two path
functions to answer "does it exist" and "open it" respectively, the latter
via an injectable ``_open_directory`` callable (mirrors this package's other
OS-facing modules, e.g. ``single_instance.py``) so
tests/test_logging_setup_location.py can exercise every branch without
actually invoking Windows Explorer.
