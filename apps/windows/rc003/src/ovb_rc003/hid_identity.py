Pure protocol/string logic, no Windows API calls, so it is unit-testable

raw_input_windows.py (Windows-only, guarded import).

Report shape (9 bytes: 3-byte HID-over-GATT report-id prefix + 6 bytes of
three little-endian uint16 Keyboard-page usage slots, zero = empty slot) and
the "back" button's Windows compatibility gap are documented in this
