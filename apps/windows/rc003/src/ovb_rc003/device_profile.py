"""Static identity facts for the Xiaomi Bluetooth Remote 2 Pro / RC003.

Derived from: device-profiles/xiaomi-rc003.json and
Sources/XiaomiRemoteBridgeMac/VoiceBridgeDeviceProfile.swift (this repository's
own already-accepted macOS adapter), kept byte-for-byte consistent with those
two files so the Windows client identifies the same physical product.
