"""Pure, platform-independent layout data for the RC003 product-photo
hotspots and the physical-button display strings shown next to each mapping
row (XRBM-030).

Hotspot coordinates are NOT re-derived from scratch: they are copied
byte-for-byte from this repository's own already-accepted macOS adapter
(``Sources/XiaomiRemoteBridgeMac/SettingsView.swift``'s ``RemoteControlDiagram``
private ``hotspot`` calls, plus its ``voiceHotspot`` for the microphone),
which King has already verified against the real product photo. Each
coordinate is a fraction (0..1) of the photo's own width/height, so it is
resolution-independent - the same fractions apply whether the photo is
rendered at 210x426 (macOS's fixed frame) or any other size, because the
photo's own aspect ratio (508:1030, see ``THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md``) is
preserved at every size (``Image.PreserveAspectFit`` in the Qt Quick view).

This module has no Tk/Qt import at all, so it is directly unit-testable
(see tests/test_remote_layout.py) and importable from a plain ``--dry-run``
smoke check without any GUI toolkit installed.
