"""Bundled, hash-gated VB-CABLE (Basic/Donationware) driver helper (XRBM-031).

Scope, drawn directly from this task's hard boundaries - read this before
touching anything below:

- VB-Audio's own VB-CABLE Basic package is Donationware: freely distributable
  as long as it stays visible/attributed/unmodified and the paid A+B/C+D
  bundles are never substituted for it (see
  <https://vb-audio.com/Services/licensing.htm>). This module only ever
  handles the ORIGINAL, unmodified ``VBCABLE_Driver_Pack45.zip`` - it never
  repacks, patches, or partially extracts it into something the vendor did
  not ship.
- This module never imports Qt/PySide6 (mirrors ``remote_layout.py``/
  ``shell_targets.py``'s Qt-free convention) - only ``qt_settings_app.py``'s
  ``DiagnosticsController`` calls into it, and only from a slot reached by an
  explicit user click plus a separate explicit confirmation (never
  automatically on page load/refresh).
- Every extraction path is verified against zip-slip (absolute paths, ``..``
  traversal, symlink members) BEFORE any file is written, and always into a
  freshly created, isolated temporary directory - never the application's own
  install/config directories.
- The vendor's OWN ``VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe`` is launched with Windows' own
  ``runas`` verb (a real UAC elevation prompt the user can cancel) - never a
  silent/unattended install flag, never scripted UI automation, never a UAC
  bypass, never ``pnputil``, never a PowerShell execution-policy bypass, and
  never a direct driver-store write. Whether the driver ends up installed is
  only ever confirmed by a later, independent
  ``windows_diagnostics.check_vb_cable_endpoints()`` recheck (typically after
  the reboot the vendor installer itself requires) - launching the setup UI
  here is never reported as installation success.
- This project's own application installer/uninstaller never call anything
  in this module; only the settings window's diagnostics page does, and only
  on an explicit user click (see ``qt_settings_app.DiagnosticsController``).
