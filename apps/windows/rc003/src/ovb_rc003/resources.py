"""Locates the optional RC003 product photo for the settings window.

The photo itself lives once at the repository root (Resources/RC003-remote-
photo.png) and is not duplicated here; this only searches a couple of
plausible relative locations (packaged build vs. source checkout) and
returns None if it can't be found, so the settings UI degrades to a text-only
button list rather than fabricating or stretching an image (see
XRBM-014 for why this candidate does not
attempt clickable image hotspots).

Frozen (PyInstaller one-dir) layout (XRBM-018 RETRY 1 P2 #4, wording
corrected in XRBM-019 P2 #7 - see XRBM-018's independent review
round 2's product-contract follow-up): the spec's ``datas`` entry collects
the photo under a ``Resources`` folder inside the COLLECT output, which
PyInstaller's bootloader exposes at runtime via ``sys._MEIPASS`` -
documented as "the path to the folder from which the frozen application is
run", i.e. wherever the bootloader actually placed the bundled ``datas``,
regardless of the exact on-disk layout. That is NOT necessarily the same
directory as the executable file itself in a modern one-dir build: since
PyInstaller 6's default one-dir layout, most bundled content (including
anything listed in ``datas``) is placed in a ``_internal`` subdirectory
next to the executable, not loose alongside it, and ``sys._MEIPASS`` points
at that ``_internal`` directory rather than the top-level dist folder the
``.exe`` itself lives in. Checking ``Path(sys._MEIPASS) / "Resources" /
...`` first (below) is correct regardless of which exact subdirectory
``_MEIPASS`` resolves to, precisely because it is always wherever the
bootloader put ``datas`` - the code does not need to know or assume the
internal layout, only trust ``sys._MEIPASS`` itself. The previous version
of this docstring incorrectly claimed ``sys._MEIPASS`` "equals the
directory containing the frozen executable itself"; that claim is wrong
for this layout and has been removed, without changing the lookup logic
itself, which was already correct. The previous *code* (before XRBM-018)
only checked a ``Resources`` path relative to the process's current working
directory, which is NOT guaranteed to be the executable's own directory
either (it depends on how the user/shortcut launched it) - a real gap
between "the photo was bundled" and "the running app can find it".
``sys._MEIPASS`` is checked first, and only when actually set (i.e. only in
a frozen build); the source-checkout and CWD-relative fallbacks below still
cover the unfrozen/dev case exactly as before.
