"""Windows-only integration checks.

These exercise the real Win32/WinRT/PortAudio adapters and therefore cannot
run on macOS/Linux, and cannot run against real hardware anywhere in this
project's CI (no device pairing/control is permitted). Every test here is
skipped outside a genuine Windows environment with the optional runtime
dependencies installed; skip reasons intentionally record this as an
explicit "not verified here" rather than a silent pass.

The bulk of this candidate's actual behavioral logic (ATVV protocol/session,
identity/HID-path fail-closed selection, the WinRT call shape, SendInput
batching/rollback, the connection supervisor, Raw Input body parsing) is
covered by cross-platform tests using fakes/dependency injection instead of
skip-guards - see tests/test_ble_transport_contract.py,
tests/test_raw_input_pure.py, tests/test_win32_input_batching.py, and
tests/test_connection_supervisor.py. What's left here is the genuinely
irreducible Windows-API-surface: does the real syscall succeed at all.

See this package's top-level README.md "Known gaps" section for the
real-machine verification steps that remain outstanding (RC003
pairing/connect/reconnect, per-button behavior including which Raw Input
event shape the device actually produces, ATVV voice playback, back-key
compatibility layer).
